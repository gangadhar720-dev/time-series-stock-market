Time series analysis and forecasting project using ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM
# Project Explanation

This project aims to analyze and forecast stock market data for HDFC Bank using various time series analysis techniques and machine learning models in Python.

## 1. Data Loading

**Explanation**: This initial step involves reading the historical stock price data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. A DataFrame is a powerful data structure in Python that allows for efficient data manipulation and analysis.



## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

**Explanation**: Before we can model the data, it's crucial to understand its structure, identify any issues like missing values, and prepare it for analysis. This step includes:

- Inspecting the first few rows to get a glimpse of the data.
- Checking data types to ensure columns are in the correct format (e.g., converting 'Date' to datetime objects).
- Handling any missing values that could affect model training.
- Setting the 'Date' column as the DataFrame index for time series operations.
- Visualizing the stock's closing price over time to observe trends, seasonality, and any unusual patterns.



## 3. Feature Engineering

**Explanation**: To improve the forecasting accuracy, we create new features from the existing data. These features capture important aspects of the time series, such as:

- **Lagged values**: Past closing prices that can help predict future prices.
- **Moving Averages (MA)**: The average price over a specified window, which helps smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends.
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**: Similar to MA but gives more weight to recent prices.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: A momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

We also handle any missing values introduced by creating these features.



## 4. Data Splitting

**Explanation**: To evaluate how well our models generalize to unseen data, we split the dataset into two parts:

- **Training set**: Used to train the forecasting models.
- **Testing set**: Used to evaluate the performance of the trained models on data they haven't seen before.

A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing, which we will use in this project. We also separate the features (input variables) from the target variable (the 'Close' price we want to forecast).



## 5. Model Selection and Training

**Explanation**: In this step, we select and train different time series forecasting models. We will focus on:

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A statistical model that uses past values to predict future values.
- **Prophet**: A time series forecasting model developed by Facebook, designed to handle time series data with strong seasonality and holiday effects.

We train these models on the training data and then use them to make predictions on the testing data. We also calculate initial evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to get an idea of how well the models are performing.



## 6. Forecasting

**Explanation**: With the trained models, we generate forecasts for future stock prices based on the historical data and the patterns learned during training.

**Code**: This step is integrated within the model training code where `predict` and `forecast` methods are used.

## 7. Visualize the Results

**Explanation**: Visualizing the actual stock prices against the forecasted prices helps us qualitatively assess how well the models are performing. We can see how closely the forecasts follow the actual trends and identify any significant deviations.



## 8. Evaluate the Forecast

**Explanation**: To quantitatively measure the accuracy of our forecasts, we use several evaluation metrics:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: The average of the absolute differences between the actual and predicted values. It gives a sense of the typical prediction error.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: The square root of the average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values. It gives more weight to larger errors.
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: The average of the absolute percentage errors. It is useful for understanding the error in relation to the actual values.

These metrics help us compare the performance of different models and determine which one is more suitable for this forecasting task.


## 9. Summary and Conclusion

**Explanation**: In this final step, we summarize the entire project, including the data analysis key findings, the performance of the models based on the evaluation metrics, and insights gained from the forecasting. We can also suggest potential next steps for further improvement, such as exploring other models like LSTM or fine-tuning the current models' hyperparameters.
